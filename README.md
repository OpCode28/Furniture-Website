# Furniture-Website
Welcome to our Furniture Showcase Website â€” a simple yet elegant static web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website demonstrates the foundational principles of front-end web development while offering a clean, modern layout perfect for a small furniture business or portfolio.

# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

# HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Structures the content of the website, including product sections, headers, image galleries, and navigation menus.

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Styles the layout with a modern, responsive design. Uses flexbox/grid for arrangement, custom fonts, colors, and smooth hover effects to enhance the visual appeal.

# JavaScript (JS):
Adds interactivity such as image sliders, lightbox galleries, collapsible menus, or simple filtering of products. Basic DOM manipulation is used for a dynamic user experience.

# ðŸª‘ Website Features:
A clean homepage introducing your furniture collection.
Responsive design that works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Product listing sections with images and descriptions.
Interactive features like hover effects, navigation toggles, or image zoom.
Contact or inquiry form (non-functional in a static site, but shows the layout).

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This project serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to build an attractive and functional website. Itâ€™s ideal for learning, portfolio presentation, or turning into a fully functional e-commerce site with backend integration later.
